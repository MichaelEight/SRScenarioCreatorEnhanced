## Origin Story
Supreme Ruler Ultimate is one of the most liked games by me & my friends. We decided to try modding it. It was fine, however stock editor has it's issues.
There is a lack of options and exporting scenarios often break for no specific reason. In the end you had to go to the files and manually change the settings.
That's why we decided to make an editor of our own. Improved over the original one.

## Usage
**Alpha Version, work in progress!**

- Download newest release
- Extract files to a folder using WinRar or other archive app
- Run `SRScenarioCreatorEnhanced.exe` file
- **If that's your first time launching the app, remember to go to editor settings (Gear icon) and edit game directory**. Example of Game Directory: *I:\Steam Games\steamapps\common\Supreme Ruler Ultimate*

### Scenario Tab

- If you've selected the right path, editor will load all available scenarios from the folder: *[game directory]\Scenario\Custom*
- Other tabs and export button will unlock once you fill all required fields
- Check "modify" to unlock tabs in which you can modify the content of that file

- Editor scale - general size of the window
- Font scale - ... font size, obviously
- Debug Messages - Some error/info message boxes are disabled to not frustrate the user because of their frequency within some stages (e.g. loading data from files). If you're experiencing any issue, it's recommended to show all debug messages. You might fix the problem yourself. [Helpful guide to resolve the issues](manual_debugging.md) If not, create an issue about that problem.
