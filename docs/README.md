## Origin Story
Supreme Ruler Ultimate is one of the most liked games by me & my friends. We decided to try modding it. It was fine, however stock editor has it's issues.
There is a lack of options and exporting scenarios often break for no specific reason. In the end you had to go to the files and manually change the settings.
That's why we decided to make an editor of our own. Improved over the original one.
